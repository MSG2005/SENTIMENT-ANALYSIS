## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on product reviews using **TextBlob**. It classifies customer feedback as **positive, neutral, or negative** based on the text's polarity. The analysis includes data preprocessing, sentiment classification, and interactive visualizations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans text by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing special characters.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Uses **TextBlob** to determine polarity and classify the sentiment.
- **Evaluation**: Compares model predictions with actual sentiment labels using accuracy and classification reports.
- **Visualization**:
  - Sentiment distribution
  - Word cloud for positive & negative reviews
  - Interactive sentiment trends using **Plotly**

## 📊 Data Processing
- The dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
- A `sentiment` column is created based on ratings:
  - **Positive (1)**: Ratings ≥ 4
  - **Neutral (0)**: Rating = 3
  - **Negative (-1)**: Ratings ≤ 2
- Each review is cleaned by:
  - Converting to lowercase
  - Removing non-alphabetic characters
  - Removing extra spaces
